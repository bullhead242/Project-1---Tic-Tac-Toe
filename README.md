General Assembly WDI Project 1

Project:

<https://jenboyd.github.io/Project-1---Tic-Tac-Toe/>

Technologies Used:

JavaScript, AJAX, Jquery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sass

Process:

   1.Develop wire frame for the design of the app.

    Wireframe:
    <https://app.moqups.com/jboyd6290/MsjqrJyz4j/edit/page/acede1747>

   2. Develop user stories to think though the funtionality of the app:

    - As a player, I want to play the game, so I can win.
    - As a player, I want to play multiple games, so I can win multiple times.\
    - As a player, I want to sign in, so I can store my games.
    - As a player, I want to sign in, so I can how many games I have played.
    - As a winner, I want to see my win, so I can celebrate.

    3. Set up basic file structure for game and create an initial commit to git hub.
    4. Layout HTML format in index.html.
    5. Add in functions for authentication elements and test by connecting to the server.
    6. Add in game logic testing funcitonality in browser thoughout the process.
    7. Once game functions locally, I added the Ajax elements to connect the game to the server.
    8. Style App using Sass, CSS and Bootstrap.
    9. Make app responsive.

Future Modifications:

    I need to fix the code that should make the app responsive, I doesn't appear to
    be working the way it should.

    I would also like to update the total games played to only show games that are
    complete and not those that have only been started.
